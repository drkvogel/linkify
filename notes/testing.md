### Manual Testing

In VSCode, do Run -> Start Debugging, or press `f5` - Program will run in new window
Create a editor, paste some text, select, and run extn either with defined shortcut (e.g. `shift+alt+i`) or from command palette (`ctrl+shift+p`, `Linkify`)
`ctrl+shift+f5` to restart debugging

>What I quickly realized is that the project uses Mocha framework for describing the tests ‚Ä¶while I am in love with Jest. üò≠ If I wanted to have Jest in my E2E tests I would have to integrate it myself. Here‚Äôs how I did it

### Jest vs Mocha vs Jasmine

[Jest vs Mocha vs Jasmine: Comparing The Top 3 JavaScript Testing Frameworks | LambdaTest ](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/jest-vs-mocha-vs-jasmine/)
>Jest is an open-source unit testing framework developed by Facebook. Mocha is a JavaScript testing framework that also supports Node.js. In addition, it provides developers with a base test framework with options such as assertion, mocking, and spy libraries. As a result, Mocha is one of the most flexible JavaScript testing libraries.
>Jest is a testing platform built on Jasmine, which originated from Facebook. It offers a selection of advanced features that makes testing just a little bit easier.
>Jasmine provides a clean and simple API for end-to-end JavaScript testing with Node.js or in the browser.

[Jest vs Mocha: Comparing the top 3 Javascript testing frameworks - DEV Community ](https://dev.to/heroku/comparing-the-top-3-javascript-testing-frameworks-2cco)
>Mocha and Jasmine are stronger for testing the back end because they were initially built for Node applications; therefore, they have more back-end tools and documentation available than Jest.
>If you use React, Jest doesn't require many dependencies, if any. However, if you don't want to dig into the react-testing-library, Jest is also compatible with some of the testing specific libraries like Enzyme.
>Jasmine is better suited for Angular.
>Mocha gives you a little more flexibility because it's commonly used for both front-end and back-end testing. You'll have to import several libraries, like Chai, to get it to work with React. While Chai isn't directly connected to React, it is the most commonly used assertion library used with Mocha. Once those dependencies are installed, it's similar to working with Jest.

Mocha it is, then, for nodejs...

[Testing Extensions | Visual Studio Code Extension API ](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension)
>Visual Studio Code supports running and debugging tests for your extension. These tests will run inside a special instance of VS Code named the Extension Development Host, and have full access to the VS Code API. We refer to these tests as integration tests, because they go beyond unit tests that can run without a VS Code instance.

>In the generated extension, you can use `npm run test` or `yarn test` to run the integration tests that:

Downloads and unzips latest version of VS Code.
Runs the Mocha tests specified by the extension test runner script.

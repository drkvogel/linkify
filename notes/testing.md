# Testing VS Code Extensions

### Manual Testing

In VSCode, do Run -> Start Debugging, or press `f5` - Program will run in new window
Create a editor, paste some text, select, and run extn either with defined shortcut (e.g. `shift+alt+i`) or from command palette (`ctrl+shift+p`, `Linkify`)
`ctrl+shift+f5` to restart debugging

### Automated Testing

[Testing your VS Code extensions | VS Code Rocks ](https://vscode.rocks/testing/)
>This will run mocha on all files in the src/test folder that match `*.test.ts`. This will also work for any folder nested in the test folder. This is useful so if you want to have separate folders for different types of tests or different subsystems, they can be separated, and it will still work fine.

>open the Debug tab in VS Code and choose the ‚ÄúExtension Tests‚Äù launch configuration. This will open an instance of VS Code with your extension installed and then run any test suite.

[Testing Extensions | Visual Studio Code Extension API ](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extension)
>Visual Studio Code supports running and debugging tests for your extension. These tests will run inside a *special instance of VS Code* named the *Extension Development Host*, and have full access to the VS Code API. We refer to these tests as integration tests, because they go beyond unit tests that can run without a VS Code instance.

>In the generated extension, you can use `npm run test` or `yarn test` to run the integration tests that:
>Downloads and unzips latest version of VS Code.
>Runs the Mocha tests specified by the extension test runner script.

>Tips#
>Using Insiders version for extension development#
>Because of VS Code's limitation, if you are using VS Code stable release and try to run the integration test on CLI, it will throw an error:
>Running extension tests from the command line is currently only supported if no other instance of Code is running. In general if you run extension tests from CLI, the version the tests run with cannot be running already. As a workaround, you can run the tests in VS Code Stable and *use VS Code Insiders for development*.
or vice versa? run the tests in VS Code Insiders and develop in VSCode Stable?

### Using Jest instead of Mocha

[End-to-End Testing VS Code Extensions via Jest: Setting Things Up | by Igor Soloydenko | Medium ](https://medium.com/@soloydenko/end-to-end-testing-vs-code-extensions-via-jest-828e5edfeb75)
>What I quickly realized is that the project uses Mocha framework for describing the tests ‚Ä¶while I am in love with Jest. üò≠ If I wanted to have Jest in my E2E tests I would have to integrate it myself. Here‚Äôs how I did it

### Jest vs Mocha vs Jasmine

[Jest vs Mocha vs Jasmine: Comparing The Top 3 JavaScript Testing Frameworks | LambdaTest ](https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/jest-vs-mocha-vs-jasmine/)
>Jest is an open-source unit testing framework developed by Facebook. Mocha is a JavaScript testing framework that also supports Node.js. In addition, it provides developers with a base test framework with options such as assertion, mocking, and spy libraries. As a result, Mocha is one of the most flexible JavaScript testing libraries.
>Jest is a testing platform built on Jasmine, which originated from Facebook. It offers a selection of advanced features that makes testing just a little bit easier.
>Jasmine provides a clean and simple API for end-to-end JavaScript testing with Node.js or in the browser.

[Jest vs Mocha: Comparing the top 3 Javascript testing frameworks - DEV Community ](https://dev.to/heroku/comparing-the-top-3-javascript-testing-frameworks-2cco)
>Mocha and Jasmine are stronger for testing the back end because they were initially built for Node applications; therefore, they have more back-end tools and documentation available than Jest.
>If you use React, Jest doesn't require many dependencies, if any. However, if you don't want to dig into the react-testing-library, Jest is also compatible with some of the testing specific libraries like Enzyme.
>Jasmine is better suited for Angular.
>Mocha gives you a little more flexibility because it's commonly used for both front-end and back-end testing. You'll have to import several libraries, like Chai, to get it to work with React. While Chai isn't directly connected to React, it is the most commonly used assertion library used with Mocha. Once those dependencies are installed, it's similar to working with Jest.

Mocha it is, then, for nodejs...
In fact, in `test/extension.test.js`:
```js
/* global suite, test */

//
// Note: This example test is leveraging the Mocha test framework.
// Please refer to their documentation on https://mochajs.org/ for help.
//

// The module 'assert' provides assertion methods from node
const assert = require('assert');

// You can import and use all API from the 'vscode' module
// as well as import your extension to test it
// const vscode = require('vscode');
// const myExtension = require('../extension');

// Defines a Mocha test suite to group tests of similar kind together
suite("Extension Tests", function() {

	// Defines a Mocha unit test
	test("Something 1", function() {
		assert.equal(-1, [1, 2, 3].indexOf(5));
		assert.equal(-1, [1, 2, 3].indexOf(0));
	});
});
```

### Test Explorer UI

[Test Explorer UI - Visual Studio Marketplace ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hbenl.vscode-test-explorer) - had installed but not enabled, now enabled in workspace. Can't figure out how to use... then spotted in docs:
>In version 1.59, VS Code added an official API and UI for running tests, which provides all the functionality of this extension and more. Therefore this extension is now deprecated.

‚ùØ npm run test

but previous error gone

### Property 'useColors' does not exist on type 'Mocha'

```
2022-03-06 13:49:31 kvogel@kvogel-surface-ubuntu:~/projects/general/projects/repos/linkify ¬±(master) ‚úó
‚ùØ npm run test
...

in `https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/blob/main/helloworld-test-sample/src/test/suite/index.ts`:
```js
	const mocha = new Mocha({
		ui: 'tdd',
    color: true
	});
	// mocha.useColors(true);
```
now seems to work:
```

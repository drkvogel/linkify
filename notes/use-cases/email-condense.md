Hi Chris,

I wanted to get in touch to see if you would be interested in a role I am currently hiring for. I am recruiting on behalf of a leading trading firm who are looking for a perm Python Developer to help them build the next generations of their systems. It's a complete project-based role, 90% of the systems this company uses have been built internally from scratch.

They are looking for someone with strong skills in Python with Django. The salary range is between £70 - 90k, with a bonus potentially well over 100k.

If this is something you would be interested in please send me your updated CV and I will be in touch.

Many thanks,
Waq

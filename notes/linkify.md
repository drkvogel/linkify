/utm_source=.*?&/g

```

n.b. original replace with regex literal was:
```js
nl = nl.replace(/utm_source=.*?\&/g, '');
```
notice escaped `&`
yes, have to escape the backslashes in the strings that get passed to the regex


should split code into sections dealing with title text and link text

doesn't take off last query string argument (because doesn't end with `&` - shouldn't include `&` in `toRemoveStrings` anyway)

should remove arguments per site, e.g. `si=x` should be removed for google.* sites, but not any other sites in case it's used in that other site and needed to display the page (i.e is not tracking)

`utm_` ones are universal, though

### local relative links

it does work pretty well, though - but local links would be the biggest gain, for me
linkify: `notes/211028-cn-issues.md` -> `[cn issues](/notes/211028-cn-issues.md)`


## defer

auto-linkify on paste into vscode?

tabs copied from TabOutliner into markdown links- linkify
  strip non-essential query string params from Google search

original pseudocode?:
foreach line that has `(http` in it:
  trim whitespace
  remove ` - Google Search ` etc
  add square brackets
  if it has `https://www.google.com/search?`:
    remove everything until `oq=`
    remove everything the rest
etc
